# speech-recognition
This is a model that recognizes the text in audios. 
The data that I have used to train this model is too big. However, you can follow this link: https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html
Then, download the Speech Commands Dataset. 
This youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPJ2jazh_KI&list=PL-wATfeyAMNpCRQkKgtOZU_ykXc63oyzp&index=2) explains in detail how to prepare the dataset, so the model can train with it.
