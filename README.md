# Speech Recognition
### This is a model that recognizes the text in audios using Python and the TensorFlow package. 
The data that I have used to train this model is too big. However, you can follow this [link](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html).
Then, download the **Speech Commands Dataset** and add it to your project repository. 
This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPJ2jazh_KI&list=PL-wATfeyAMNpCRQkKgtOZU_ykXc63oyzp&index=2) explains in detail how to prepare the dataset, so the model can train with it.
