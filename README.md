# Speech Recognition
### This model recognizes the text in audio files using Python and TensorFlow. 
The data that I have used to train this model is too large to be shared here. However, you can follow this [link](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html).
Download the **Speech Commands Dataset** and add it to your project repository. 
This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPJ2jazh_KI&list=PL-wATfeyAMNpCRQkKgtOZU_ykXc63oyzp&index=2) explains in detail how to prepare the dataset so that the model can be trained and evaluated. 
This model could predict keywords such as *up*, *left* and *off* from personally recorded audio files of my family and me!
